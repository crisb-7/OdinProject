        <p>I use the paragraph tags to effectively create text. This is some sample text to display, don't mind my silly little words, hehe.</p>
        <p>If I didn't use the tag, all of this text would be clumped together, and I don't want that.</p>
        <h1>All headings 1</h1>
        <p>But, what if I want to semanticallly mark text as <strong>important</strong>? Aha! I would use the <strong>strong</strong> HTML tag.</p>
        <h2>All headings 2</h2>
        <h3>All headings 3</h3>
        <h4>All headings 4</h4>
        <h5>All headings 5</h5>
        <h6>All headings 6</h6>
