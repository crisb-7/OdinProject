        <title>Playing with text</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p> I use the paragraph tags to effectively create text. This is some sample text to display, don't mind my silly little words, hehe.</p>
        <p> If I didn't use the tag, all of this text would be clumped together, and I don't want that.</p>
        <h1> All headings 1</h1>
            <p> But, what if I want to semanticallly mark text as <strong>important</strong>? Aha! I would use the <strong>strong</strong> HTML tag.</p>
        <h2> All headings 2</h2>
            <p> No, no, wait. I'd rather <em>emphasize</em> some text... Can I combine them, though? <strong><em>OH YES I CAN</em></strong> </p>
        <h3>All headings 3</h3>
            <p> Most importantly, there is no hierarchy. I can nest them in the opposite way, and <em><strong>it still works</strong></em>. </p>
        <h4>All headings 4</h4>
            <p> This part of the lesson is about nesting and indentation, but this is not new for me cause I've been working with heinous nested for loops (I'm a physicist, duh). </p>
        <h5>All headings 5</h5>
            <p> There are some hidden comments in the html file, look for them </p>
            <!-- This is an obvious one -->
        <h6>All headings 6</h6>
        <!-- hehe, I'm a comment -->
