# Odin Project Lessons

In this repository I follow each of the tutorials on the Odin Project for two paths:

- Foundations Course
- JavaScript Course

The repo includes any assignment/project to better understand the things learned in every course. It can be an assignment/project set by the Odin curriculum or set by myself to apply the concepts as I see fit.
